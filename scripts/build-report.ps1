<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Build a static Allure HTML report from the latest pytest run.

.DESCRIPTION
  Wraps `allure generate ... --clean` into a single command. After it
  finishes, IMPORTANT: the report MUST be opened over HTTP, not file://,
  because Allure loads its widgets via AJAX and browsers block XHR from
  file:// origins (you'll see seven "Loading..." panels forever).

  To view the built report:
      .\scripts\open-report.ps1            # uses `allure open`
  Or share it: zip the entire `reports\allure-html\` folder; the recipient
  can serve it with any static-file server (`python -m http.server` works).

.NOTES
  Requires the Allure CLI on PATH.
    - Windows:  scoop install allure
    - npm:      npm install -g allure-commandline
