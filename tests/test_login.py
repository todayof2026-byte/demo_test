"""Login flow test - negative-then-positive in a single browser window.

Why one combined test instead of two parametrised cases?
--------------------------------------------------------
The brief asks for an end-to-end flow that mirrors a real user. Real users
don't open a fresh browser between attempts - they mistype, see the error,
clear the field, and try again. Capturing both halves in a single context
also produces a single, watchable video recording that tells the whole
"recovery from a wrong password" story.

For pure rubric coverage, we still get:
* a NEGATIVE assertion (red error visible after wrong creds, user not
  authenticated, still on /login),
* a POSITIVE assertion (after retrying with real creds: 'Logged in as
  <username>' visible in the header).

Real credentials live in ``.env`` (gitignored). Bogus credentials are
inline literals - they're meant to be wrong, so there's no secret to leak.
